# React Project using MUI to build a Login/Signup Page
Feel free to pull this down and use as you wish. It is a simple login and signup page that uses Material UI. 
You can download this locally to your machine and then enter the following commands.
- npm install (this installs all of the dependencies if you are using npm)
- yarn add (if you are using yarn as your package manager)
- npm start (starts the development server locally)
- The page will open up in a new Web tab at localhost:3000

Hope you like what I came up with if it was handy and saved you lots of time. 
Feel free to give me a star it would be greatly appreciated. 
Have fun and know that things might be tough and challenging but once you start figuring things out. 
The fun really begins and our imagination is the only thing that will hold us back.

Cheers â˜•

The project should look like this except without the usage of Axe Developer tools if they are not installed:
